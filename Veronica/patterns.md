# Two Pointers
```javascript
/*
WHEN TO USE: very helpful for sorted arrays & Linked Lists when finding a set of elements with a condition
NOTE: for UNSORTED inputs that expect NONCONTIGUOUS sets for outputs, helpful to sort and then use two pointers
variables to consider:
start position (usually start at 0) --> condition for iterating
end poition (usually start at .length-1)--> condition for iterating
condition: target

currentcondition > target: decrement end pointer (end--)
currentcondition < target: increment start pointer (start++)
*/

  let left = 0,
    right = arr.length - 1;
  while (left < right) {
    const currentSum = arr[left] + arr[right];
    if (currentSum === targetSum) {
      return [left, right];
    }

    if (targetSum > currentSum) {
      left += 1; // we need a pair with a bigger sum
    } else {
      right -= 1; // we need a pair with a smaller sum
    }
  }
  return [-1, -1];
}
```
# Fast and Slow Pointers
```javascript
/*
WHEN TO USE: when dealing with cyclic Linked Lists or array
MIDPOINT: since fast pointer is moving 2x as fast as slow pointer, when fast reaches the end slow will be at the middle
slow pointer will never catch fast pointer unless there is some kind of loop/cycle

*/

# Reverse Linked List
```javascript
/*
variables to consider:
current: initally set to head, tracks what were currently reversing
previous: initally set to null, tracks the previous current
next: current.next
to reverse: set current.next to previous
reset:  set previous to current, set current to next

for reversing a sublist:
-Skip the first p-1 nodes, to reach the node at position p.
-Remember the node at position p-1 to be used later to connect with the reversed sub-list.
-Next, reverse the nodes from p to q using the same approach discussed in Reverse a LinkedList.
-Connect the p-1 and q+1 nodes to the reversed sub-list.
*/
function reverse(head) {
  let current = head,
    previous = null;
  while (current !== null) {
    next = current.next; // temporarily store the next node
    current.next = previous; // reverse the current node
    previous = current; // before we move to the next node, point previous to the current node
    current = next; // move on the next node
  }
  return previous;
}
```
# Sliding Window
```javascript
/*
WHEN TO USE: CONTIGUOUS subset with a condition
variables to consider:
start position --> condition for iterating
end poition --> condition for iterating

-accumulator that doesnt need helper storage variable(ie. maxsum, max length seen so far, min length, count of something, etc )
-hashMap (if frequency of more than two types of items needs to be track, ie. number of chars seen, index, freq of char, etc. )
-accumulator that DOES need helper storage variable (ie. most seen char frequency, index of relevant char)

looking for max: extend (end++) when valid, and shorten (start++) when invalid
looking for min: shorten (start++ when valid), and extend (end++) when invalid
**length: end-start+1
*/

    windowSum = 0;
    for (j = i; j < i + k; j++) {

    // repeating 'maxRepeatLetterCount' times, this means we can have a window which has one letter
    // repeating 'maxRepeatLetterCount' times and the remaining letters we should replace.
    // if the remaining letters are more than 'k', it is the time to shrink the window as we
    // are not allowed to replace more than 'k' letters
